## In Progress Features

### 1. Bullet Physics Integration
- Created header files for BulletRigidBodyComponent, BulletPhysicsWorld, BulletCollisionShapeComponent, and BulletConstraintComponent
- Created source files for all Bullet Physics components
- Made the implementation robust with conditional compilation (#ifdef HAS_BULLET)
- Created test executables to demonstrate the integration
- **Status**: Code is ready, but requires Bullet Physics library installation

### 2. Vulkan Renderer Fix
- Attempted to fix Vulkan renderer driver compatibility issues
- Simplified graphics pipeline configuration for better compatibility
- **Status**: Still encountering VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER (-13)

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Vulkan Renderer Issues
- **Problem**: VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER (-13) when creating graphics pipeline
- **Cause**: Driver compatibility issues or missing Vulkan SDK
- **Solution**: Requires proper Vulkan SDK installation and driver updates

### 2. Bullet Physics Integration
- **Problem**: Missing Bullet Physics headers and libraries
- **Cause**: Bullet Physics not installed on the system
- **Solution**: Code is ready for integration, requires Bullet Physics installation

## Recommendations

### 1. For Vulkan Renderer
1. Install the latest Vulkan SDK from LunarG
2. Update graphics drivers to the latest version
3. Ensure Vulkan validation layers are properly configured
4. Consider using a different graphics API (DirectX, OpenGL) if Vulkan continues to have compatibility issues

### 2. For Bullet Physics Integration
1. Download and install Bullet Physics library
2. Configure CMakeLists.txt to properly find and link Bullet Physics
3. The existing code provides a solid foundation for physics simulation

### 3. For Future Development
1. The codebase is well-structured and ready for the next steps
2. The Bullet Physics integration provides a solid foundation for physics simulation
3. The Vulkan renderer issues can be addressed by installing proper drivers or using a different graphics API
