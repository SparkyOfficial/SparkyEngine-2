- **Post-Processing**: Bloom, motion blur, depth of field, color grading

## Building

1. Ensure you have CMake 3.20 or higher installed
2. Ensure you have Vulkan SDK installed
3. Ensure you have GLFW installed
4. Run `build.bat` for basic build or `build_advanced.bat` for advanced features

## Running

After building, you can run:

- `build\Game\Release\SparkyGame.exe` - Main game
- `build\Game\Release\SparkyDemo.exe` - Simple demo
- `build\Engine\Release\advanced_engine_demo.exe` - Advanced demo showcasing new features
- Various test executables in `build\Engine\Release\`
